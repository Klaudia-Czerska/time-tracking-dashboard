## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I have learned a lot about CSS and the proper use of Grid. I also tried to make my website accessible and responsive.
I used modules for the JavaScript part of the code, I see that it helps with debugging.
This is also my first time using Fetch!

### Continued development

- working with files
- using preprocessors for CSS
